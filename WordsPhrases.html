  <p style = "font-size: 40px; text-align:center;">This chart illustrates six common and essential phrases translated into visual hand signs. The signs focus on basic social etiquette: HELLO involves a flat hand moving away from the head; GOODBYE is a basic open-hand wave; PLEASE uses a flat hand circling the chest; THANK YOU moves a flat hand from the chin outward; YES is communicated by a closed hand (S handshape) moving up and down at the wrist; and NO is signed by pinching the fingers and thumb together, then quickly opening them. These illustrations serve as a simple guide to fundamental, high-frequency signs used for greeting and responding politely.</p>
