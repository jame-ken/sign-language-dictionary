   <p style = "font-size: 40px; text-align:center;">American Sign Language (ASL) was formally invented in 1817 when Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc founded the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. It was created by combining French Sign Language, brought by Clerc, with local American sign languages and signed English that were already in use. The language evolved as students from different parts of the country brought their own home and community signs, which then mixed with French Sign Language to create a standardized ASL</p>
